description: Overview of the Yodes system architecture.
---

Yodes is a node-based generative AI workflow engine. This section outlines the technical architecture, data modeling, and execution flow for the platform.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

Yodes utilizes a **hybrid execution model** where node processing is distributed between the client and the server based on computational requirements.

### Frontend Engine (Web)
- Processes lightweight nodes.
- Handles UI-centric logic (e.g., `Note`, `Toggle`).
- Manages real-time canvas previews.
- Built with **React** and **Vite**.

### Backend Engine (Node.js)
- Executes heavy generative tasks.
- Handles terminal operations.
- **Terminal Nodes:** Templates marked with `isTerminal: true` run exclusively on the backend.
- **Data Flow:** Backend nodes can pipe results (images, video, LLM streams) back to frontend nodes for visualization or further non-terminal processing.
- Built with **Hono** and **Prisma**.

## Workspace Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo:

- `packages/db`: Prisma schema definitions and database client generation.
- `packages/types`: Shared TypeScript interfaces for `NodeResult` and `NodeConfig`.
- `apps/gatewai-fe`: The core application (Frontend + Backend).
- `apps/guides`: This documentation site.

## Key Concepts

### Node System
The architecture follows a "Template-Instance" pattern.
- **NodeTemplate**: The definition for a node type.
- **Node**: A specific instance on the user's canvas.
- **Handle**: Connection points supporting multiple data types.
- **Edge**: Links connecting source and target handles.

### Processing & Execution
Execution is tracked via a batching system:
- **TaskBatch**: Collection of tasks from a single execution.
- **Task**: Lifecycle of a single node's execution.

### Asset Management
- **FileAsset**: Manages media generated by AI or uploaded by the user.
