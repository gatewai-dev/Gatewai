# GATEWAI

**The Multi-Modal Generative AI Workflow Engine.**

Gatewai is a powerful, node-based orchestration platform designed to bridge the gap between complex AI models and intuitive creative workflows. Whether you're generating cinematic videos, composing multi-layered images, or building sophisticated LLM chains, Gatewai provides the canvas for your imagination while looking good on frontend.

This project is built for the Gemini 3 Hackathon.

## Key Pillars

### Adaptive Execution Engine

Gatewai utilizes a **Flexible Hybrid Model** where nodes are processed across both the frontend and backend. Rather than sticking to rigid roles, our engine evaluates the requirements of each task—from real-time canvas manipulations to AI operations and executes them at the browser or on backend when necessary.

### Multi-Modal Mastery

Stop switching between tools. Gatewai offers a unified interface for:

* **Video**: Text-to-video, cinematic extensions (up to 148s), and first-to-last frame interpolation.
* **Image**: Generative fill, real-time painting, and advanced compositional tools.
* **Audio**: High-fidelity text-to-speech and deep audio understanding.
* **Text**: State-of-the-art LLM orchestration using Gemini 3.

### ⚡ Real-time Creativity

Don't wait for results. Our interactive canvas allows for instant feedback, enabling a fluid creative process where AI becomes an extension of your brush. Gatewai uses WebGL at both backend and frontend to for identical outputs at pixel-level. What you see at browser is what AI gets.
