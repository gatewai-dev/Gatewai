## Key Pillars

### Adaptive Execution Engine

Gatewai utilizes a **Flexible Hybrid Model** where nodes are processed across both the frontend and backend. Rather than adhering to rigid roles, our engine evaluates the requirements of each task—from real-time canvas manipulations to heavy AI operations—and executes them in the browser or on the backend as needed for optimal performance.

### Multi-Modal Mastery

Stop switching between tools. Gatewai offers a unified interface for:

* **Video**: Text-to-video and first-to-last frame interpolation powered by **Veo 3.1**, alongside professional video composition tools.
* **Image**: Generative fill, real-time painting, and advanced editing tools (Blur, Crop, Modulate, etc.), with image generation powered by **Nano Banana**.
* **Audio**: High-fidelity text-to-speech and deep audio understanding via the latest **Gemini 3** models.
* **Text**: State-of-the-art LLM orchestration using **Gemini 3 Flash or Pro**, depending on your specific use case.

### Real-Time Creativity

Don't wait for results. Our interactive canvas provides instant feedback, enabling a fluid process where AI becomes a natural extension of your creativity. Gatewai utilizes **WebGL rendering** on both the server and browser to ensure pixel-perfect parity. What you see in the browser is exactly what the AI processes, and vice versa.
