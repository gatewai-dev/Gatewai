# Gatewai API Client

A API client library to run workflows using API.

When a new API request made, the workflow will be duplicated without data exists in it. For that reason, you should set the inputs you want (Import Node) or Text node in API request.

Please check examples inside `apps/gatewai-fe/scripts` folder on how to do it.
